I am a post-doc at the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) of Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Prof. Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/){:target="_blank"}, and a member of [NeuLab](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~neulab/){:target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on machine learning and deep learning approaches for modeling, predicting, improving, and generating source code, a field we call Programming Language Processing.

I obtained a PhD in the department of Computer Science at the Technion, advised by [Prof. Eran Yahav](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~yahave/){:target="_blank"}.

Previously, I served 7 years as an officer onboard a missile ship in the Israeli Navy. 
Later, I completed my BSc _summa cum laude_ at the Computer Science Department at the Technion, as an alumnus of The Rothschild-Technion Scholars Program for Excellence. 
Between 2014-2016, I worked at Microsoft R&D center in Haifa, developing data security services for the cloud. 
Between June-September of 2018, I interned at Google New-York, researching neural models for speech recognition.

In addition, I hold a B.A. in Humanities.

I am happily married to Lee and father of Gur ðŸ™‚
