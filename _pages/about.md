    title: "Target Audience for Starbucks Rewards App"
    text: "In this project, I analyzed the customer behavior in the Starbucks Rewards Mobile App. After signing up for the app, customers receive promotions every few days. The task was to identify which customers are influenced by promotional offers the most and what types of offers to send them in order to maximize the revenue. I used PCA and K-Means clustering to arrive at 3 customer segments (Disinterested, BOGO, Discount) based on Average Conversion Rates and explored their demographic profiles and shopping habits."

I am a post-doc at the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) of Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Prof. Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/), and a member of [NeuLab](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~neulab/).

My research focuses on machine learning and deep learning approaches for modeling, predicting, improving, and generating source code, a field we call Programming Language Processing.

I obtained a PhD in the department of Computer Science at the Technion, advised by [Prof. Eran Yahav](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~yahave/).
In addition, I hold a B.A. in Humanities.

Previously, I served 7 years as an officer onboard a missile ship in the Israeli Navy. Later, I completed my BSc summa cum laude at the Computer Science Department at the Technion, as an alumnus of The Rothschild-Technion Scholars Program for Excellence. Between 2014-2016 I worked at Microsoft R&D center in Haifa, developing data security services for the cloud. Between June-September of 2018, I interned at Google New-York, researching neural models for speech recognition.

I am happily married to Lee and father of Gur ðŸ™‚
